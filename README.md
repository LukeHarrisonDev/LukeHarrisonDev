## Welcome to my GitHub

Hello, I'm Luke, I recently graduated from Northcoders' 13 week Software Development bootcamp specialising in JavaScript. It's been a blast, I learnt so much about creating Full Stack applications and realised the possibilities that the tech industry has to offer.

I'm an enthusiastic, creative and motivated worker with a strong people-focused approach. During my professional development at Junior Jam, I realised I had a passion for problem-solving which led me to coding. I wanted to transition my career into the tech industry so that I could develop both professionally and personally, whilst contributing to development within the sector. Now I'm eager to kickstart my new career by actively looking for a role to that utilities my skill set.

On top of all that, I'm a musician from Bradford and have played bass in bands since I was 15 and taught guitar since I was around 20, I've always enjoyed the production side of music and other things like films and therefore I dabbled in sound design for while. I also play video games like Zelda, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear and The Last Of Us series' to name a few.
